# Security Improvements for Asaba Bank

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security improvements implemented to address authentication vulnerabilities and enhance the overall security posture of the Asaba Bank application.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Debug Logging Removal
**Issue**: Console logs exposing sensitive information in production
**Fix**: 
- Removed all `console.log` statements from `lib/supabase/client.ts`
- Disabled debug mode in Supabase client configuration
- Removed debug logs from authentication flows

### 2. Password Strength Validation
**Issue**: No password strength requirements
**Fix**:
- Implemented comprehensive password validation in `pages/register.tsx`
- Requirements: 8+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character
- Real-time password strength feedback
- Prevents weak password creation

### 3. Sensitive Data Protection
**Issue**: SSN stored in plain text in user metadata
**Fix**:
- Removed SSN storage from user metadata
- Added input sanitization for all user inputs
- Implemented proper data validation and sanitization
- SSN should be stored in separate encrypted table (future enhancement)

### 4. Rate Limiting Implementation
**Issue**: No protection against brute force attacks
**Fix**:
- Added client-side rate limiting for login attempts
- Maximum 5 attempts per 15-minute window
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Server-side rate limiting in admin API

### 5. Session Management
**Issue**: No session timeout
**Fix**:
- Implemented 30-minute session timeout
- Activity-based session renewal
- Automatic logout on inactivity
- Enhanced session security in `hooks/useAuth.ts`

### 6. Security Headers
**Issue**: Missing security headers
**Fix**:
- Added comprehensive security headers in `next.config.js`
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Strict-Transport-Security
- Content-Security-Policy
- Referrer-Policy

### 7. Admin API Security
**Issue**: Admin API lacked authentication
**Fix**:
- Added authentication checks to admin endpoints
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for admin operations

### 8. Input Sanitization
**Issue**: XSS vulnerabilities possible
**Fix**:
- Implemented input sanitization functions
- HTML entity encoding
- Length restrictions on inputs
- Proper validation for all user inputs

### 9. Audit Logging System
**Issue**: No security event tracking
**Fix**:
- Created comprehensive audit logging system (`lib/audit-logger.ts`)
- Tracks login attempts, failed logins, account creation
- Logs suspicious activities and admin actions
- Audit table with proper indexing and cleanup

### 10. Error Handling
**Issue**: Sensitive information in error messages
**Fix**:
- Generic error messages for users
- Detailed logging for administrators
- Proper error handling without information leakage

## New Security Features

### Audit Logging
- Comprehensive event tracking
- Severity-based alerting
- Automatic log cleanup (1 year retention)
- Admin-only access to audit logs

### Rate Limiting
- Client-side login attempt limiting
- Server-side API rate limiting
- Account lockout mechanism
- Configurable thresholds

### Session Security
- Activity-based timeout
- Automatic session renewal
- Secure session storage
- Session expiration handling

### Input Validation
- Email format validation
- SSN format validation
- Password strength requirements
- Input length restrictions

## Database Security

### Audit Logs Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
    event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
    ip_address INET,
    user_agent TEXT,
    details JSONB,
    severity TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (severity IN ('low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical'))
);
```

### Row Level Security
- Admin-only access to audit logs
- Proper RLS policies
- Secure data access controls

## Environment Variables Required

```env
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Email Configuration (for alerts)
SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
SMTP_PORT=your_smtp_port
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_user
SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_password
```

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users only have access to necessary data
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Fail Securely**: System fails to secure state
4. **Input Validation**: All inputs validated and sanitized
5. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of security events
6. **Session Management**: Proper session lifecycle management
7. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
8. **Security Headers**: Protection against common web vulnerabilities

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Security Events Monitored
- Failed login attempts
- Account lockouts
- Suspicious activities
- Admin actions
- Session timeouts
- Rate limit violations

### Alert Thresholds
- 5 failed login attempts → Account lockout
- 10 failed attempts from same IP → IP block
- Critical security events → Immediate alert
- High severity events → Escalated alert

## Future Enhancements

1. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
   - SMS-based 2FA
   - TOTP-based 2FA
   - Hardware security keys

2. **Advanced Threat Detection**
   - Machine learning-based anomaly detection
   - Behavioral analysis
   - Geographic access monitoring

3. **Encryption Enhancements**
   - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
   - Field-level encryption for PII
   - Secure key management

4. **Compliance Features**
   - GDPR compliance tools
   - Data retention policies
   - Privacy controls

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Penetration Testing**
   - Regular security assessments
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Code security reviews

2. **Security Testing**
   - OWASP ZAP testing
   - Burp Suite testing
   - Manual security testing

3. **Compliance Testing**
   - PCI DSS compliance
   - SOC 2 compliance
   - Regulatory compliance

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Process
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Analysis**: Audit log review and investigation
3. **Containment**: Immediate response actions
4. **Eradication**: Root cause removal
5. **Recovery**: System restoration
6. **Lessons Learned**: Process improvement
